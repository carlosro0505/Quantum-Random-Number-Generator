# Quantum-Random-Number-Generator
This is a random-number generator that uses quantum computing. 
It takes input from the user via the terminal. The integer taken from the input is used to raise 2 to its power and that result is subtracted by 1 in order to generate a range. In other words, the range is 0 to 2^n - 1. If the user inputs 3 for example, the range will be 0 to 2^3 - 1 = 7 (0 to 7).
I completed this program using Jupyter Notebook.
